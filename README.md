Runalytix : An Intelligent Code Validator and Optimizer for Automation
Problem : 
Runbooks often contain complex Shell, PowerShell, or HTTP scripts prone to syntax and logic errors.
Errors usually appear only during runtime, causing failures and time-consuming debugging.
Inefficient task logic, redundant steps, and poor structuring increase execution time and resource usage.
Manual intervention is often needed to fix broken automation, reducing system reliability.
No real-time, intelligent feedback system exists during Runbook creation.
Developers rely on trial-and-error, which leads to production risks and delays.
Proposed solution:
This project is an Al-powered assistant embedded directly into Calm Runbooks.
It analyzes script quality, logic, and context in real-time.
Detects errors, unsafe patterns, and inefficiencies before execution.
Provides actionable suggestions with clear explanations.
Works seamlessly inside Calm UI no switching context required.
